# HoriseonAccessibility

Increase accessibility of Horiseon webpage

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

Horiseon website was inaccesible due to overuse of <div>. These have been replaced by semantic html elements and alt text has been added to images enabling the website to have better accessiblity for those with disabilities.
